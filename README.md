A smart ML-based system that recommends the best crop and fertilizer based on soil nutrients, pH, weather, and rainfall. Helps farmers make informed decisions to improve yield and sustainability using real data and predictive models.
**🌾 Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System**
This project is a Machine Learning-based Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It helps farmers and agricultural professionals choose the most suitable crop and fertilizer based on soil and environmental parameters.

**🔍 Work Done in the Project**
✅ Data Loading & Preprocessing: Loaded and cleaned the Crop_recommendation.csv dataset, checked for missing and duplicated values, and explored statistical summaries.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the distribution of features such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

**🌱 Crop Recommendation**: Developed a model to predict the best crop to grow based on input features using machine learning algorithms.

🧪 Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the model with accuracy metrics.

🧾 Fertilizer Recommendation (Coming or In Progress): Placeholder or future work for recommending fertilizers based on crop and soil health parameters.
